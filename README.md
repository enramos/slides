Slides repository
================================

This repo stores some of the presentations I create. I'm using
github pages as an easy place to store and publish the HTML or
SVG slides so I have them always available for me and anyone.

Lately I've started to use one repo per talk so this way is
easier to fork and distribute every them. Check my 
[repositories](https://github.com/jsanz?tab=repositories) page.

All my slides and talk materials are available at http://jorgesanz.net/talks/
