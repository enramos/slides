This repo stores some of the presentations I've done. I'm using
github pages as an easy place to store and publish the HTML or
SVG slides so I have them always available for me and anyone.

In order to access the slides you should switch to the gh-pages
branch, as all the content of this repo lives on that branch:

https://github.com/jsanz/slides/tree/gh-pages

Or you can directly browse the slides at:

http://jsanz.github.com/slides.html

I stored some presentations on this repo, but in order to let
people fork only an specific talk I'm creating new repos for every
talk I do.

Have a nice day!!
