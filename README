This repo stores some of the presentations I create. I'm using
github pages as an easy place to store and publish the HTML or
SVG slides so I have them always available for me and anyone.

In order to access the slides you should switch to the gh-pages
branch, as all the content of this repo lives on that branch.

Alternatively you can directly access the slides at http://jsanz.github.com/slides/

Have a nice day!!
